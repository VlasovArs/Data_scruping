# Data_scruping

The client's task is to collect all the images from this site into a pdf file.

What I did to solve it: I looked at the address of each picture, saw that its address changes at the end of the link and only the digit of the picture changes. I collected all the images in the get_data() function and collected them into a pdf file in the write_to_pdf() function.

Result: I successfully collected all the images into a pdf file. I couldn't upload this file because it weighs more than 25 megabytes, but I attached all the photos from the site to prove my work.
